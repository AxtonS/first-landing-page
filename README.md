My name is Axton Smith
I am learning web development,
flexbox was tricky thus far,
figured most stuff out pretty easily
but doesn't seem to grow or shrink *exactly*
how I expect, hoping to fix that!
Was fun to make though, I'll come back and improve
the following: 
    - buttons
    - link behaviors
    - font style differences
    - relative flex of everything
